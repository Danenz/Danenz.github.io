				In Rotorua you are surrounded by geothermal mudpools, waterfalls, red wood forests and  geysers erupting on a daily basis. </p>

				<p>All though Rotorua smells like rotten eggs (aka Sulphur) it is the heartbeat of New Zealand as far as adventure goes.
					White water river rafting here offers the highest commercially rafted waterfall drop, Tutea Falls at 7m! 
					Gondalaz, luges, Ogo's, bubbling mud pools, hot springs and heaving markets has made this a tourist hot spot, literally, of New Zealand.
					You can even skydive over this magical land to get the bigger picture!</p>

					<p>17 lakes provides the best fishing opportunities, its a mountain bike heaven and a multi sport playground...a VEGAS in so many way!</p>

			<span>Mt Maunganui</span> <p> the most popular spot for both New Zealanders and tourists to visit over the summer season for obvious reasons! Mount Maunganui is located atop a sandbar that connects Mauao  (THE MOUNT – situated at the end of the sandbar) to the mainland. The thin strip is 3 blocks wide at its thinnest part and are loaded with bars, restaurants, hotels and activities. This formation gives the residents beautiful white beaches (main Beach) on the one side hosting every water sport you can think of, and the harbour (Pilot Bay) on the other side which has cruise ships visitors almost all year round.</p>


			<p>Moturiki Island also known as "Leisure Island" is the small strip attached with a man made sand bridge to the main beach. Fishing or jumping off the cliff here is an every day occurrence. It also provides a beautiful angle on The Mount and to watch the surf.</p>

			<p>Pilot Bay is on the harbour side of the strip and is most popular by locals for fishing off the harbour deck or launching your boat to go the neighbouring island, Matakana, for a surf. This harbour also hosts up 78 cruise ships visits per year, which is a huge boost for the local economy. A number of water activities which includes, swimming with dolphins, Orca sightseeing, harbour cruises and snorkel adventures to the legendary Mayor Island are also operated from these docks.</p>

				<p>The <span>Coromandel</span> Peninsula is most definitely one of the BIGGEST attractions of New Zealand.</p>

				<p>It is 40km wide at its broadest point and with its steep and hilly features it is largely covered in rainforest. Due to the nature of the land, the Coromandel's polulation clusters over five towns (Coromandel, Whitianga, Thames, Tairua and Whangamata) with around 1000 inhabitants.
					The 1970s saw thousands of hippies relocate from large cities around New Zealand to the Coromandel in search of an environmentally friendly lifestyle. The Coromandelwas also formerly largely known for its gold mining industries.<br>
					This beautiful Peninsula with its numerous small islands and island groups lying offshore offers so many natural luxuries!
					Hot Water Beach is known for digging your own bathtub in the sand where hot water from the underground hot springs meet the cold water of the ocean for a perfect temperature. 
					Alot of the surfing spots have freedom camping near by, making it a good place to visit and surf on a budget.</p>

					<p>Cathedral Cove in the Te-Whanganui-a-Hei Marine Reserve can only be reached by foot or boat and is an underwater wonderland for snorkeling and diving. It is the most photographed rock in NZ and with good reason....it is breathtaking! <br>
						The very popular town called Whangamata is a must-do! Not only has it got great waves for surfing but it also has Donut Island (Whenuakura Island).</p>


						<p>Donut Island is accessible by kayak, sup or boat and it is a large collapsed volcanic blow hole that has created a turquoise lagoon in the centre of the island, surrounded by fauna and flora. Pure MAGIC!</p>
